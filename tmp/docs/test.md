# **Understanding the Code:**

- **`content_scripts`:** This array defines the content scripts to be injected into web pages.
- **`matches`:** This property specifies the URL patterns that the content script will match. In this case, `<all_urls>` matches all web pages.
- **`js`:** This property indicates the path to the JavaScript file containing the content script's code.
- **`run_at`:** This property determines when the content script will be executed. `document_idle` means it will run after the page is mostly loaded.

**Modifying for Specific URL Matching:**

To run the code only for specific URLs, you can replace `<all_urls>` with more precise patterns. Here are some examples:

- **Exact match:**

  ```json
  "matches": ["https://example.com/specific-page"]
  ```

- **Subdomain match:**

  ```json
  "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"]
  ```

- **Path-based match:**

  ```json
  "matches": ["https://example.com/path/*"]
  ```

- **Multiple patterns:**

  ```json
  "matches": ["https://example.com/page1", "https://example.com/page2"]
  ```

**Example:**

To run the code only on pages within the `https://example.com` domain, you could use:

```json
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["https://example.com/*"],
    "js": ["/js/connect.js"],
    "run_at": "document_idle"
  }
]
```

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Wildcards:** The `*` character can be used as a wildcard to match any sequence of characters.
- **Regular expressions:** More complex matching patterns can be achieved using regular expressions within the `matches` array.
- **Permissions:** If your content script needs to access certain browser APIs or data, you might need to request specific permissions in your manifest file.

By carefully defining the `matches` property, you can ensure that your content script is executed only on the desired web pages.

**Markdown Files: A Beginner's Guide**
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to learn and use. It's often used to create documents, notes, and even websites. Markdown files have a `.md` extension.

**Basic Markdown Syntax**
Here are some essential Markdown elements:

- **Headings:**
  - Use `#` to create headings. The more `#` you use, the smaller the heading.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
    # This is a H1 heading
    ## This is a H2 heading
    ### This is a H3 heading
    ```

- **Paragraphs:**
  - Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
    This is a paragraph.

    This is another paragraph.
    ```

- **Emphasis:**
  - Use `*` or `_` for italics.
  - Use `**` or `__` for bold.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
    *This is italic text.*
    **This is bold text.**
    ```

- **Lists:**
  - Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists.
  - Use `1.` for ordered lists.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    - Item 3

    1. First item
    2. Second item
    3. Third item
    ```

- **Links:**
  - Use `[link text](URL)` to create links.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
    [Google](https://www.google.com)
    ```

- **Images:**
  - Use `![alt text](image URL)` to insert images.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
    ![A cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg)
    ```

- **Code Blocks:**
  - Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks.
  - Specify the language (optional) after the first backtick.
  - Example:

    ```markdown
        ```python
        def greet(name):
            print("Hello, " + name + "!")
        ```

    ```
